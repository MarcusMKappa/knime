# Knime Projects

A few words about me (https://www.linkedin.com/in/marek-krysiak/),

Experienced analyst with years of experience in the banking sector. Well organized, critical and focused on the quality of the delivered product. 

During my career, I have held team leader roles for the majority of my time, and previously as a specialist analyst. My main area of expertise is credit risk, to which I have devoted over 25 years of my career, additionally training many financial institutions, banks, financial regulators as well as private clients in this subject. I have participated in international symposia, conventions and training courses on credit risk, broadly defined finance, banking and investment activities. I have often acted as an advisor to teams and participated in implementation projects in banks. 

I am competent in delegating tasks, time management and process planning. Besides credit risk, my current interests also include areas such as Data Science or Product Management, in which I would like to deepen my knowledge.

The last years of my career, I have spent developing my interest in the field of futures trading, using machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. In addition, I served as a credit risk consultant for business clients. I also developed my skills in analytical environments such as KNIME and Python, and became familiar with Data Science and Machine Learning.
